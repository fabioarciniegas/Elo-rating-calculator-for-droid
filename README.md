A Droid App to calculate your Elo rating after a tournament (or single game).

Slightly different (better?) than other similar tools in that (a) it uses different K factors for different scenarios (e.g. uscf u1800 different from uscf u1200)  and (b) allows the calculation over a matches, not just a single game.
